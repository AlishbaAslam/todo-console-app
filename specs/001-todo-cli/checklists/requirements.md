# Specification Quality Checklist: Todo Console App - Phase I

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] **SQ-001**: No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] **SQ-002**: Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] **SQ-003**: Written for non-technical stakeholders

- [x] **SQ-005**: No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] **SQ-006**: Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] **SQ-007**: Success criteria are measurable
- [x] **SQ-008**: Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] **SQ-009**: All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] **SQ-010**: Edge cases are identified
- [x] **SQ-011**: Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] **SQ-012**: Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] **SQ-013**: All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] **SQ-014**: User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] **SQ-015**: Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] **SQ-016**: No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass validation.
- Specification is ready for `/sp.plan` phase.
- No clarifications were needed—all requirements could be filled with reasonable defaults based on the feature description.
